# Harvest
In recent times there has been a greater push towards sustainability and food sovereignty. As part of this, many people have begun growing food in gardens and public spaces. Harvest is an app to facilitate the process of growing and harvesting food. Among other features, users should be able to: Keep track of the food they have sowed/planted/harvested View analytics of their food yield (e.g. weight harvested this month, predictions for future yields, etc.) View planting information for listed foods (e.g. when to sow, when to harvest, etc.) View nutritional information for listed foods (e.g. calories, carbs, protein, fibre, etc.) Share their progress with other users etc.
